2_sensors.c && 3_sensors.c are interfacing BH1750 light sensor on STM 32 Nucleo Board


2_sensors.c is implemented by using both sensors on same I2C, since for each I2C maximum 2 sensors can be connected

and for 3_sensors.c it is implemented by using 2 I2C's



The next phase of the project will be continued using VEML ADAFRUIT light sensor
